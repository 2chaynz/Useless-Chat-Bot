# Useless-Chat-Bot

During the Hackathon "La Nuit de l'Info" I had to create a Chat Bot that was useless. Here there is only the model whitout the interface shown just below. On the ML side it is using NLP with lemmatization and sequential Neural networks via Keras. Our team built a webapp based on the Paper clip game and the theme was the Libre and Linux, that's why the bot has some tags about Linux etc...

There are many markdown notes and math explanations of things I learned or found important and didn’t want to forget. On the DevOps side, my colleagues helped me deploy everything on the web app.

To link the Python script with the Svelte app, we used a Flask API.
